# web project 
a website to store human input (voice,text,definition) into a database and export it as an output.
i used php to process the data, mysql to store it and bootstrap template for the UI
i didnt have time to create a way to export the database to the users. i thought of exporting it as an exel file or a text file with the data seperated by dots.
